* Merge autolabel spots that are too close together [important!]
* Add interactivity for autolabel spots with modifier (like ALT) 
* Check training parameters for sanity (e.g. kernelsize odd)
* Make startup faster somehow...
* Make remote worker startup faster - this would be a massive improvement
* Implement remote worker evaluation of density!
* Make colors selectable
* Test other neural network frameworks, like Flux.jl
